# Welcome

My name is Craig and I am a creator and engineer.

## Background

Art has always been my passion, and engineering my curiosity. I’m self taught in both regards, going on 15+ years of experience now. I’ve worked as a professional Photographer, I’ve worked in marketing, print, and for the last several years as a Full Stack Engineer. In all of my work I’ve worn many hats and that’s the way I like it.

At its core my inspiration always come from a desire to make things that people will value, whether it’s software, professional services, design, photography, physical goods, or consulting.

When inspiration hits, I have the skills to research, prototype, build, and analyze. I can hold technical know-how in one hand and business sensibility in the other, simultaneously building while checking in on economic feasibility, and consumer needs.

## Endeavours

I tell you this because I think it’s important to acknowledge our failures, and recognize that with every failure there was great success in learning. I may have never been able to quit my day job to work for myself but I learned how to incorporate a partnership, I learned accounting, marketing, material sourcing, budgeting, taxes, product market fit,
