<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This project is a Trello style kanban board using only the HTML5 drag and drop spec. There are tons of javascript libraries built for drag and drop functionality but I wanted to build this project to try out the HTML5 drag and drop and see if those libraries are a thing of the past.</p>

<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>

<p>The HTML drag and drop API itself is actually much simpler than I would have expected, it only has 8 events and can be initiated with just a couple lines of JS and a couple HTML attributes, but with simplicity comes limitation. The difficulties I faced on this project weren’t so much in figuring out how to make the tech work but really in figuring out what the tech was not capable of.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, in terms of pure functionality I believe HTML drag and drop can do everything you need. But what it can’t do is those little extra things like having a drag state, or animations, that make the users life a little nicer.</p>
