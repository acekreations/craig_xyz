<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>My name is Craig and I am a creator and engineer.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Art has always been my passion, and engineering my curiosity. I’m self taught in both regards, going on 15+ years of experience now. I’ve worked as a professional Photographer, I’ve worked in marketing, print, and for the last several years as a Full Stack Engineer. In all of my work I’ve worn many hats and that’s the way I like it.</p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>My pursuit stands as it always has, very bluntly, <strong><em>make cool shit</em></strong>. These are the words that move me forward and push me to create things that are better. Better than what has come before, better than expectations and better than what will come next. I draw inspiration to create from technology, art, innovators, and a desire to solve problems. At its core my inspiration always come from a desire to make things that people will value, whether it’s software, professional services, design, photography, physical goods, or consulting.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>I sit somewhere between an artist, an engineer, a thinker, and an entrepreneur. Although some consider a generalist to not be good enough at any one thing to succeed, I see it as an asset for exploration and a tool to overcome adversity. When inspiration hits, I have the skills to research, prototype, build, and analyze. I can hold technical know-how in one hand and business sensibility in the other, simultaneously building while checking in on economic feasibility, and consumer needs.</p>

<h2 id="endeavours">Endeavours</h2>

<p>I’ve started more businesses than I can remember. Not a single one of those business has ever out earned my day job. I tell you this because I think it’s important to acknowledge our failures, and recognize that with every failure there was great success in learning. I may have never been able to quit my day job to work for myself but I learned how to incorporate a partnership, I learned accounting, marketing, material sourcing, budgeting, taxes, product market fit,</p>
